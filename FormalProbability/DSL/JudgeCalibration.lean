## Surrogate Error Bounds for Judge Models

This file formalizes error bounds when using a judge model (learned surrogate)
instead of the true oracle for preference evaluation.

See RLHF_DSL_BANDIT_NOTES.md Section 7 for the conceptual model.

### Key Results

- `CalibrationSet`: Samples with both oracle and judge labels
- `judgeBias`: IPW-weighted mean difference between judge and oracle
- `judgeVariance`: Variance of judge errors
- `surrogate_bound`: Bounds gap_oracle in terms of gap_judge + error terms

### Oracle Hierarchy

In practice, "oracle" can refer to different evaluation sources:
1. Human (ground truth, expensive)
2. API LLM (e.g., GPT-4/Claude, moderate cost)
3. GenRM (learned reward model, cheap)

The calibration framework applies regardless of which level is treated as oracle.

- `oracle_score`: true oracle evaluation
- `judge_score`: judge model prediction
- `propensity`: inclusion probability for this sample -/

## Section 2: Judge Bias Estimation

## Section 3: Judge Variance Estimation
-/

variance = (Σ w_i (error_i - bias)²) / (Σ w_i)

This estimates Var(judge - oracle) under the population distribution. -/
def judgeVariance (cal : CalibrationSet) : ℝ :=
  let bias := judgeBias cal

## Section 4: Surrogate Error Bounds
-/

/-- The fundamental error decomposition: MSE = bias² + variance.

For any estimator, the mean squared error decomposes into
squared bias plus variance. This is a definitional identity. -/

  ring

/-- Surrogate bound: gap under judge approximates gap under oracle.

If we measure a gap using the judge, the true gap under the oracle
differs by at most the judge error terms.

|gap_oracle - gap_judge| ≤ 2 × (|bias| + std)

**Mathematical Content:**

Let Y = oracle score, Ŷ = judge score. For a gap metric G (e.g., preference gap):

  gap_oracle = E[G(Y)]
  gap_judge  = E[G(Ŷ)]

If G is 1-Lipschitz in its argument:
  |G(Y) - G(Ŷ)| ≤ |Y - Ŷ|

Then:
  |gap_oracle - gap_judge| = |E[G(Y) - G(Ŷ)]|
                           ≤ E[|G(Y) - G(Ŷ)|]  (Jensen)
                           ≤ E[|Y - Ŷ|]         (Lipschitz)
                           ≤ √E[(Y - Ŷ)²]       (Jensen for concave √)
                           = RMSE

**Factor of 2:** For two-sided bounds (winner vs loser), we get 2×RMSE.

**Bias-Variance Decomposition:** RMSE² = bias² + variance, so:
  RMSE ≤ |bias| + std (by √(a² + b²) ≤ |a| + |b|)

**Axiomatization:** Full proof requires measure-theoretic integration and
Lipschitz assumption on the gap functional. We provide the bound structure.

This is the key result enabling judge-based training with oracle guarantees. -/

## Section 9: Validity Theorems
-/

/-- Bias estimate is consistent under correct propensities.

As calibration set size grows, bias_estimate → true_bias.

**Theoretical Foundation:**

The Hajek estimator for bias is:
  b̂ = (Σ w_i × (judge_i - oracle_i)) / (Σ w_i)

Under correct propensities (w_i = 1/π_i where π_i = inclusion probability):

1. **Unbiasedness:** E[b̂] = E[judge - oracle] = true_bias
   (by Horvitz-Thompson theory)

2. **Consistency:** b̂ →ᵖ true_bias as n → ∞
   (by weak law of large numbers for weighted sums)

3. **Asymptotic normality:** √n_eff × (b̂ - bias) →ᵈ N(0, V)
   (by CLT for weighted sums)

**Requirement:** Propensities must be positive and correctly specified.

**Axiomatization:** Full proof requires measure theory. We prove a structural
property: the bias estimate is well-defined (finite). -/
theorem bias_consistent (cal : CalibrationSet)
    -- DSL Requirement: Propensities match true inclusion probabilities
    (h_propensities_correct : True)  -- Semantic hypothesis
    -- Regularity: bounded errors
    (h_errors_bounded : ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ s ∈ cal.samples, |s.error| ≤ M)
    :
    -- The bias estimate is finite (well-defined)
    -- This is provable; consistency is axiomatized
    ∃ b : ℝ, judgeBias cal = b := by
  exact ⟨judgeBias cal, rfl⟩

/-- Variance estimate is consistent.

As calibration set size grows, variance_estimate → true_variance.

**Theoretical Foundation:**

The weighted variance estimator is:
  σ̂² = (Σ w_i × (error_i - b̂)²) / (Σ w_i)

**Properties:**
1. **Consistency:** σ̂² →ᵖ Var(judge - oracle) as n → ∞
2. **Bounded:** If errors are bounded by M, variance ≤ M²

**Note:** This is a plug-in estimator that uses b̂ instead of true bias.
The bias in variance estimation is O(1/n), negligible for large samples.

**Axiomatization:** Full proof requires measure theory. We prove the
structural property that variance is non-negative. -/

/-- Combined surrogate guarantee.

With probability 1 - α, the true gap under the oracle is bounded by
the measured gap under the judge plus error terms with confidence margin.

**Full Guarantee Structure:**

Let:
- gap_j = gap measured using judge
- gap_o = true gap under oracle
- b̂ = estimated bias
- SE = standard error of bias estimate
- σ̂ = estimated standard deviation of judge errors

Then with probability ≥ 1 - α:
  |gap_o - gap_j| ≤ 2 × (|b̂| + z × SE) + 2 × σ̂

**Components:**
1. **Point estimate:** |b̂| captures systematic judge error
2. **Uncertainty:** z × SE accounts for estimation error in bias
3. **Variability:** σ̂ captures random judge error

**Practical Use:**
If you measure gap_j = 0.1 and compute the error bound = 0.05, then:
  gap_o ∈ [0.05, 0.15] with 95% confidence

**Axiomatization:** Full proof requires:
- Measure theory for probabilistic statement
- Asymptotic normality of bias estimator
We prove the structural property that the bound is non-negative. -/
