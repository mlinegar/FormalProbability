# CLT Module: Central Limit Theorem

## Overview

This module formalizes the **Central Limit Theorem** and supporting probability theory.
It provides the measure-theoretic foundations for asymptotic analysis.

## Prior Work and Attribution

This CLT development comes after and is independent of earlier formalizations.
We give full credit to those efforts and make the sources explicit.

- Remy Degenne's Lean formalization (https://github.com/RemyDegenne/CLT) significantly predates
  this work.
- The Isabelle/HOL formalization in 2014 (Jeremy Avigad, Johannes Hoelzl, Luke Serafin,
  "A formally verified proof of the Central Limit Theorem", arXiv:1405.7012v4) was explicitly
  provided to the AI assistants used to draft parts of this development.

## Main Results

| Theorem | File | Statement |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Helly Selection | HellySelection | Tight sequences have convergent subsequences |
| Lévy Continuity | LevyContinuity | Characteristic function convergence ⟹ distribution convergence |
| CLT | CLT | Lindeberg-Feller CLT for triangular arrays |

## Key Concepts

### Tightness

A sequence of probability measures {μ_n} is **tight** if:
```
∀ε > 0, ∃K compact: μ_n(K) > 1 - ε for all n
```

### Characteristic Functions

The characteristic function of μ is:
```
φ_μ(t) = E[exp(itX)] = ∫ exp(itx) dμ(x)
```

### Lévy Continuity Theorem

If φ_n → φ pointwise and φ is continuous at 0, then:
- φ is a characteristic function
- μ_n ⟹ μ (weak convergence)

### Central Limit Theorem

For triangular array {X_{n,k}} with:
- Row independence
- Lindeberg condition

We have:
```
(Σ_k X_{n,k} - E[...]) / σ_n ⟹ N(0,1)
```

## Axioms Used

This module uses no axioms beyond Mathlib foundations.
